      <p>You know this guy never finishes a goddamn project he starts, and now it's time to change that. If you are reading this it means that he has started building another web portfolio to showcase the (very little) range of projects in which he has worked on.</p>
      <p>Please be patient. He will eventually finish a project. Maybe by the end of 2017. Maybe not. Only time will answer our questions.</p>
